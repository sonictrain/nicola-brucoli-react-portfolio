## Intro
Frontend Dev React Portfolio: Stylish, concise frontend showcase with React, Tailwind, and Material-Tailwind. 

## Description
The following project consist in a frontend developer showcase developed using React, React Routers, Tailwind CSS, and Material-Tailwind. This portfolio creation tool utilises JSON files for a better content customisation, allowing users to define their skills, mark featured ones, list and manage project visibility (public or private). The integration of React Routers ensures an intuitive navigation experience, guiding visitors through various sections with ease. The portfolio's visual appeal is achieved through Tailwind CSS styling, complemented by Material-Tailwind for consistent UI elements. Users can input personal data, including their current position, full name, and more. Additionally, a contact form with React hooks ensures data integrity with conditional alerts, offering a comprehensive and engaging portfolio experience for frontend developers.
